	Sean looks up at the night sky, "Still can't see the stars," for as
 long as he can remember, the New York sky has been a thick blanket of smog.
He closes his eyes and imagines what the blue sky his mom and grandma often
reminisced about looked like. Sean begins to hear his facemask beeping...
He has to head into the city shelter that houses most of New York.
	When he arrives at the shelter, he is escorted into the office of the
head of security and instructed to stand at the end of a line of other young 
boys. He spots his friend Peter at the other end of the room, and the two
exchange a worried look. He stands there for another 30 minutes while other
youths are added to the line, some he knows, some he's never seen before. 
There is an air of anxiety as the last boy is escorted in and they are left 
in silence.
